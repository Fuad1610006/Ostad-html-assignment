      <h2>Hyderabadi Biriyani</h2>
      <div>

        <p>
          Hyderabadi biryani (also known as Hyderabadi dum biryani) is a style of biryani originating from Hyderabad, India made with basmati rice and meat (mostly mutton). <br>
           Originating in the kitchens of the Nizam of Hyderabad, it combines elements of Hyderabadi and Mughlai cuisines. Hyderabad biryani is a key dish in Hyderabadi cuisine <br>
          and it is so famous that the dish is considered synonymous with the city of Hyderabad. <br>
        </p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Hyderabad was conquered by the Mughals in the 1630s, and ruled by its Nizams. Mughlai culinary traditions joined with local traditions to create Hyderabadi cuisine. <br>
               Local folklore attributes the creation of Hyderabadi biryani to the chef of the first Nizam, Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I, in the mid-18th century, during a hunting expedition. <br>
              In 1857, when the Mughal Empire declined in Delhi, Hyderabad emerged as the center of South Asian culture, resulting in a mix of innovations in Hyderabadi biryani.

          <h3>Origin</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              The exact origin of the dish is uncertain. Despite legends attributing it to the Nizam's chef, the biryani is of South Indian origin, derived from pilaf varieties <br>
              brought to South Asia by Arab traders. Pulao may have been an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. <br>
              The distinction between "pulao" and "biryani" is arbitrary. Hyderabadi biryani developed engrossing Deccani or Telangana flavors into it, as stated by the Himayat Ali Mirza,<br>
              the great-grandson of Mir Osman Ali Khan. Himayat said that this evolution had taken place in the Asaf Jah's Kitchen.

          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Base ingredients are basmati rice, goat meat or (sometime chicken or beef), dahi, fried onion and ghee. Spices include cinnamon, cloves, cardamom (elaichi), bay leaves,<br>
              nutmeg, papaya paste, caraway (shahi jeera), mace flower (javitri), star anise (biryani flower), lemon, and saffron. <br>
              Hyderabadi biryani is of two types: the kachchi (raw) biryani, and the pakki (cooked) biryani.

      <h2>Beef Khichuri</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          It's been raining a lot lately.  When it pours on the outside with dark cloud surrounding the environment, Bengalis crave for kichuri. <br>
          A piping hot plate of khichuri is just what the heart desires when a Bengali come home soaked from the rains. Some Tagore songs on the background, <br>
          and a quick nap if someone can squeeze it in is the definition of a classic rainy day for Bengalis. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Rain is almost synonymous with eating khichuri for Bengalis. It is the ultimate comfort food for rainy days or any days as a matter of fact. <br>
          Bengalis have a very soft spot for this down home one-pot rice dish. The aromas of rice, dal flavored with ghee is intricately intertwined with <br>
          the smell of the wet earth fresh from the raindrops. In Bangladesh, khichuri is mainly served with fried Hilsha, beef rezala or an egg curry and alu bhorta. <br>
          A simple omelette served with khichuri can also be a simple delicious soulfood for Bangladeshis. In my family, we often make a quick pickled onion to serve with kichuri. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Khichuri recipes vary from one household to another. The consistency differs, the spices differ, and sometime the ingredients such as the type of lentil or vegetables put in the <br>
          mishmash may differ depending on the personal preference. However, with all its differences, khichuri is an easy meal to prepare and guaranteed to be delicious each time. <br>
          Bhuna khichuri has a pilaf like texture and considerably drier than other versions of khichuri.  My mom makes bhuna khichuri with mung bean. <br>
          The Bengali khichuri is what the world calls Khichdi and the British calls Kichdee. Other alternatives you may see is khichri, khichdee, khichadi, khichari, kitcheree, kitchree and so on. <br>
          This rice dish can be served on a regular day or during parties and celebrations. <br>

      <h2>Chicken Pulao</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Pulao is a close cousin of Biriyani and varies in many aspects. It is so much lighter, less spicy & less greasy than a Biriyani. This makes it more of a comfort food than a luxarious treat. <br>
          In Indian cuisine, vegetable pulao is very popular and is made more often in the homes.However you won't find Chicken Pulao being made often since a lot people love Biriyani over pulao. <br>
          Growing up, My mom made this Chicken Pulao more often for a weekend meal. It was served with Korma. Down in South India, West Bengal as well as in our country, a pulao is always served <br>
           with a gravy side dish like Korma. Basically pulao is a toned-downed version of Biriyani and is a one pot dish that is not layered. Chicken Pulao can be made in a regular pot, <br>
            traditional pressure cooker or instant pot.
